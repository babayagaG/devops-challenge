### Task 2
Please provision an AWS ECS Cluster with EC2 instance using Terraform.

Then configure the AWS ECS Service to run the `Cody` application using Terraform.

Please use **Terraform module** as much as possible.

#### Outcome: 
You have to show your Terraform code in `main.tf`. You may create additional `.tf` file to suit your coding style since you need to setup VPC, Subnet, ALB, MySQL container, etc.
